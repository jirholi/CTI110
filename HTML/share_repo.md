# Sharing a Repository

To share a repository in GitHub, you can use the repository's URL to share it with others. Here's how you can find and share the link:

Navigate to the Repository:

- Log in to your GitHub account
- Go to the main page of the repository you want to share.
- Copy the URL: The URL in your browser's address bar is the direct link to your repository. You can copy this URL.
  - OR Use the Clone or Download Button: Alternatively, inside the repository, you can click on the green "Code" button above the file list. It opens a dropdown menu where you can find the URL to clone the repository using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI. This link can also be shared with others who might want to clone the repository.
- To share the repository with someone directly:

  - You can simply send them the copied URL through email, messaging apps, or any other means of communication.

If you want them to collaborate on the repository, you might also need to add them as a collaborator in the repository settings under the "Manage access" section.
